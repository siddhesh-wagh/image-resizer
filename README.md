# Image Resizer

A Python-based tool for resizing images to custom dimensions using the **Pillow** library. This script is ideal for resizing images for web usage, print formatting, or any application where images need specific dimensions.

## Features
- **Customizable Dimensions**: Resize images to any width and height.
- **Simple Usage**: Specify input path, output path, and desired size.
- **Lightweight**: Uses the efficient Pillow library.
- **Format Preservation**: Saves resized images in the same format as the original (or can be changed as needed).

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pillow Library**

Install Pillow by running:
```bash
pip install pillow
```

## Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/siddhesh-wagh/image-resizer.git
cd image_resizer
```

### 2. Prepare the Script

Specify the paths and dimensions in the script.

```python
from PIL import Image

# Define image paths and dimensions
img_path = "input_image.png"         # Path to the input image
resized_image_path = "output_image.png"   # Path to save resized image
new_size = (width, height)           # Replace with desired dimensions, e.g., (12668, 9000)

# Open, resize, and save
with Image.open(img_path) as image:
    resized_image = image.resize(new_size)
    resized_image.save(resized_image_path)

print("Resized image saved at:", resized_image_path)
```

### 3. Run the Script

Save the script as `resize_image.py`, and then run it using:

```bash
python resize_image.py
```

Ensure that `img_path` points to your source image file, and that `new_size` is updated to your target dimensions (e.g., `(12668, 9000)`). The resized image will be saved to `resized_image_path`.

## Example

To resize an image to 12668x9000 pixels:

```python
new_size = (12668, 9000)
```

Run the script to get the resized image in the specified output path.
